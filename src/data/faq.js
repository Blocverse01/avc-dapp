That said, no content which could be considered even remotely offensive to anyone will be considered. The onboarding process for a new project is extensive. Each project will be required to deploy on testnet and be tested thoroughly before migrating and deploying on mainnet. Once the project is ready to go live the AVC team proceed with minting on their own or partner platforms"
