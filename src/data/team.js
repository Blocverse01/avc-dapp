      "Hailing from Nigeria, LeriQ is a tech executive, music producer, sound engineer, and all-around creative who recently won a Grammy for his work on superstar Burna Boy’s latest album titled Twice As Tall. Deemed one of the Top 5 producers on the entire continent, real name Eric Isaac Utere has found his niche in curating an eclectic sound that reels in African rhythm and combines them with the pulse of electronic dance music. Growing up in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in a household of 6 siblings (all boys), LeriQ drew a lot of his influence from his parents—with his dad being a graphic artist. With unlimited music surrounding him, LeriQ began his musical journey at the young age of 13. He fondly recalls meeting one of his dad’s friends, who was a producer. “I didn’t know that you could record and overlay, keep recording and create music.  Currently signed to Burna Boy’s Spaceship label, LeriQ is responsible for some of Burna’s biggest hits. From “Like To Party ” to “Say You Love Me” featuring Wizkid to 4 songs on Twice As Tall.  LeriQ released a producer album in 2015 titled The Lost Sounds.
